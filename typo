In every pages:
	There is a number "5" floating, like a page number.

Overview
	Why Prolog
		* Title "Why Prolog ?": there should be no space before the question mark.
		* "knowledge processing, natural langage processing, [and] reasoning."
		* "in unification grammars[,] and"
	Symbolic Artificial Intelligence
		* In Turing's test: "Martine. And you ?" : there should be no space before
		  the question mark.
		* "grandmother’s cupboard[.]"
		* "[lead] some famous people to predict [that] such a surge of machine
		  intellectual capabilities [] could lead to the end of humankind"
		* "You’ll [] never [be] sure that"
		* "structural matching[,] and structure-sensitive"
	Topics
		* "parallel processes[,] and rely ideally"

First steps in Prolog
			* In the "Summary", items are not aligned: the second one is two spaces less
			  indented than the other three.
	Prolog
		Historical Background
			* "One would rather have asked [to] the machine"
			* "expressing knowledge in a déclarative form": French remnant, remove the
			  accent on "déclarative".
			* "One of them is the creation of [a] Prolog version"



First-order logic
Resolution algorithm
1) After "a. True", [a, not b, not c] "annihilates" c in clause [...] : the comma between not b and not c is missing.
2) The anwser to SyntacticDeduction is in French.
Predicate logic
A logic for predication
1) "If there is an interpreter, then any two individuals communicate" : [can] communicate.
Semantics
1) A formula F is valid if F is true in any model of the language. : [in every models]
2) The predicate '*' does not appear in (∀x) (a, x, x).

Intro
"overestimate" -> overestimation
//Mention DeepL ?
"rather than [an] utopia"
"re-+valeur+-iser+-é+-e[+s]"
"every year at each [level]"
"engineering[,] and language sciences."
Correction for "ArgumentStructure" is partialy in French.
